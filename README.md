# Eyes_Wide_Open

This project explored the intricate relationship between attention, technology, and mindfulness. It is an attempt to understand how we can leverage emerging tools to enhance focus and well-being in an age dominated by digital distractions.
Through the integration of eye movement tracking, visual graphics using shaders, and delta wave signals, the project aimed to captivate attention and induce a state of relaxation conducive to concentration and meditation. Drawing inspiration from immersive installations and personal experience, it aspires to create a space where viewers can momentarily escape the chaos of modern life and immerse themselves in a unique sensory experience.
